## Overview

This is a personal e-commerce application that I developed to showcase my skills in web development and e-commerce functionality. The project is built using modern web technologies like React, Django REST Framework, JWT, etc. It allows users to login to their account, browse and view products, add them to cart and checkout to place an order.

## Features

- User registration and authentication system with email verification to activate user account
- Landing Page that shows 10 top rated products for top categories
- Product catalog with filters, search bar, add to cart/remove and quantity update functionality
- Product detail page with image, rating, specifications, add to cart/remove, quantity update and buy now functionality
- Shopping cart to manage selected products
- Checkout process with shipping address add/update functionality and order summary
- Django Admin panel to manage products, orders, and user accounts
